## Webpack

### Install webpack

```bash
yarn add webpack webpack-cli --dev
```

<details>
<summary>More</summary>

This project started with `Webpack 4` in beta version:

```bash
# add webpack 4 (currently on 4.0.0-beta.2)
yarn add webpack@next webpack-cli --dev
```

</details>

### Zero Config (#0CJS)

#### Entry / Output

No need for explicit specify `entry` and `output` properties in the webpack configuration.

In _Webpack 4_ those fields are defaulted to:

```json
{
    "entry": "./src",
    "output": "./dist"
}
```

#### Mode

Webpack `mode` reduce the required configuration for an useful build:

* `development`: this mode provide useful error messages and is optimized for speed (unminified bundle)
* `production`: enables optimizations out of the box (scope hoisting, tree shaking, minification, etc.)

```bash
webpack --mode production
```

There is also another hidden `none` mode which disables everything (available only inside the configuration object).

### Changes

- Dropped _Node.js 4_ support. Therefore, more benefits from ES6 features (optimizations from V8).
- Sets of defaults with **production** and **development** modes.
- Changes on plugins (Some actives depending on **mode**. `CommonsChunkPlugin` was removed)
- Optimizations, performance boost and many more...
- Read changeset of [Webpack v4.0.0](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v4.0.0)
